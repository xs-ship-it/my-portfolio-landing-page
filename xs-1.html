    <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p>For a very long time i was interested in learning how to code,I also wanted to know how websites work behind what we see on the interface.
         I love solving problems and i knew that by learning how to code i would be able to come with systems that can solve tasks thst would have required a lot of mental and maybe even physical strength.
